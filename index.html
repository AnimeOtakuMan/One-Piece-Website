                <p>Gol D. Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed
                    the
                    Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change
                    throughout
                    the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in
                    the
                    world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who
                    dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite
                    possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.

                    Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather
                    than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun,
                    Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure
                    that
                    leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps
                    of
                    his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy
                    adventures,
                    unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of
                    all
                    fortunes—One Piece.</p>
